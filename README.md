# ScriptableObject Management for Unity

This project provides a ScriptableObjectManager class for easily managing ScriptableObjects in Unity. This static helper class can be used to load and cache ScriptableObjects efficiently.

Features
ScriptableObject Loading: Seamlessly loads ScriptableObjects from predefined paths.
Caching: Efficiently caches loaded ScriptableObjects for quick access, reducing load times and improving performance.
Enum-Based Management: Utilizes an enumeration to manage different ScriptableObject types, ensuring type safety and easy maintenance.
Usage
ScriptableObject Types
Define the ScriptableObject types you support using an enumeration. This project includes a sample enum called ScriptableObjectType.

ScriptableObjectManager Class
The ScriptableObjectManager class provides static methods for loading and caching ScriptableObjects.

LoadScriptableObject<T>(): Generic method to load and cache the specified type of ScriptableObject. If the ScriptableObject has been previously loaded, it returns the cached instance.
GetScriptableObjectType<T>(): Helper method to map the generic type to the corresponding enum value.
Example Scenario
Imagine you have a ScriptableObject named GameSignals. You would define it in the ScriptableObjectType enum and then use the ScriptableObjectManager to load it efficiently in your game.

Error Handling
The ScriptableObjectManager includes error handling to ensure smooth operation:

Logs an error if a ScriptableObject cannot be loaded from the specified path.
Logs an error if a path for the specified ScriptableObject type is not found.
Throws an ArgumentException if an unsupported ScriptableObject type is requested.
